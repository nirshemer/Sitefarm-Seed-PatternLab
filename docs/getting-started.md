# Getting Started

## Prerequisites 

If you are a Windows user then it is recommended you use [Git for Windows](http://git-for-windows.github.io/).

You'll need [node.js](http://nodejs.org).

After installing Node you should install Gulp globally

    $ sudo npm install --global gulp

## Install and setup
    
After cloning and changing into that directory, run this to install dependencies (you may need to use `sudo` if you get errors):

    $ npm install

You may have to run that again for updates; so it may be wise to save this: `$ npm install`. **If you have any problems; this is the first thing to run.**

Finally, to do an initial build of the site and start watching for changes run `gulp`

    $ gulp
